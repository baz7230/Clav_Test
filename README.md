Hi John,

I'm Bob Anderson. Since there's no way to give comments on peer review, I thought I'd try this method. For the two answers on your submission where you expressed difficulty -- in that kind of situation, I have found the Discussion Forums for the course to be stunningly helpful. You may have to wade through disgruntled comments, but a lot of folks out there are trying to help.

I don't have a quick answer for your HelloWorld issue; check the Forums on that one. For the Forking question, however, you need to go to the source (jtleek's repository: https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing) and click on the Fork button that's somewhere on the screen. That's what I did to get to here with your file.

Now I'll try my first Pull request ... not that this note should become part of your file, just so you can see my comments. Good luck.

Bob
